# Persian Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

This repository contains code for preprocessing and analyzing Persian text data for sentiment and emotion recognition tasks.

## Overview

This project provides tools and scripts for working with Persian language sentiment and emotion datasets. The code is organized in numerical order for a step-by-step workflow from data preprocessing to analysis.

## Datasets

Due to licensing restrictions, the CSV files are not included in this repository. Please download them from the following sources:

- **Sentiment Dataset**: [Persian Sentiment Analysis Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/instatext/persian-sentiment-analysis-dataset)
- **Emotion Dataset**: [Arman Text Emotion Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/Arman-Rayan-Sharif/arman-text-emotion)

## Code Organization

The codebase is organized in numerical order for reproducibility:

1. `01_sentiment_dataset_cleaning.py`: Cleans and preprocesses the Persian sentiment dataset
2.  02_emotion_dataset_cleaning.py: Cleans and preprocesses the Persian emotion dataset
